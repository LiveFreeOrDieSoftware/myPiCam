Raspberry Pi Outdoor/Security Camera Case

The name is based on the other myHome products. 
What Happens in my home should stay in myHome.
Home Automation Should NOT BE Home Invastion!

This site will host downloadable 3D printable models, setup scripts, etc. (at some point).

The model is in 4 parts.
Cowl: This is the outer covering, and is a large print
Lens Cowl: This is a separate housing to protect the camera board from the elements.
Base: This is the bottom, and the place where most of the components are mounts. Print this and the cam-wall first have your Pi all set up by the time the other two parts print.
Cam-wall: This is a vertical component that allows for mounting the standard and HQ footprint camera boards. It is held in place by the front standoffs for the RPi.
